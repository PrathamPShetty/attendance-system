By leveraging advanced facial recognition technology, the system captures and verifies faces in real-time, eliminating the need for traditional, time-consuming methods like roll calls or manual sign-ins. It ensures accuracy by preventing proxy attendance and securely stores data in a well-structured database comprising users, students, and attendance records. This system not only saves time but also provides instant updates and comprehensive attendance reports, making it an efficient and scalable solution for managing attendance in schools, colleges, workplaces, and events.")
